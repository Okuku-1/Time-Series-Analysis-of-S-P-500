## &P 500 Time Series Analysis with ARIMA
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the S&P 500 Index from 2000 to 2023 using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling. The project demonstrates time series data preprocessing, model fitting, diagnostics, and forecasting.

## Project Overview
The objective of this analysis is to apply ARIMA modeling to the S&P 500 index data, evaluate model assumptions, and generate forecasts. Key tasks include:

Importing and visualizing the historical S&P 500 dataset.
Performing stationarity checks using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
Identifying optimal ARIMA model parameters using AutoCorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial AutoCorrelation Function (PACF) plots.
Fitting ARIMA models and conducting diagnostic checks on residuals.
Forecasting future index values and evaluating forecast accuracy using metrics like RMSE and MAPE.
